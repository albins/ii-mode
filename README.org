* About
ii-mode is an Emacs mode for handling files created by ii. It can help you to stay logged in even through emacs restarts.

The model of using Emacs for interfaces to external programs, rather than running them inside the elisp environment itself also seems more elegant.

This allows for a much more detached use of irc, not having to keep one buffer open for each channel, but still getting notified if someone pings you.

GPL v3 or later.
* Dependencies
- GNU Emacs :: not tested in any other flavor.
- krl/ii :: The minimalist filesystem based irc client from [[http://tools.suckless.org/ii/][suckless]]. Patched up version reqired. Available @ http://github.com/krl/ii
- inotify-tools :: ii-mode uses inotifywait from this package to keep track of file changes.
* How to use
Put ii-mode.el in your emacs path and write something like this in your init file:

: (require 'ii-mode)
:  (setf ii-irc-directory "/home/username/irc/")
:  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist `(,(concat ii-irc-directory ".*/out\\'") . ii-mode))

To customize behavior you can use ii-mode-hook, this is what I do:

: (add-hook 'ii-mode-hook (lambda () 
:                           (visual-line-mode)                          
:                           (local-set-key (kbd "RET") 'newline)
:                           (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-s") 'ii-send-message)))

Look in the source variable definitions for customizing face colors etc.

* Notification
By default, you only get notified on user queries. To ii-mode, this is channels with ii-directories not starting with "#" or "&". To get notified on mentioning of your user name or favourite dish just set the variable 'ii-notify-regexps in your config like this:

: (setf ii-notify-regexps '("\\bkrl\\b" "\\bkrrl\\b" "\\basparagus\\b"))

If you have a channel you want to keep extra track of, put it in the list 'ii-notify-channels and you will be bugged when it's updated.

: (setf ii-notify-channels '("irc.efnet.net/#data_kraft"))

You will se a "*ii*" in the global modeline when a notification is activated. To see which and/or to visit them, bind the command 'ii-visit-notified-file to a key sequence of choice.

To visit any of the channels tracked by ii-mode use 'ii-visit-channel-file, and to visit any of the server channels use 'ii-visit-server-file.

* Left to do 
- fix the annoying buffer modified really kill etc things.
